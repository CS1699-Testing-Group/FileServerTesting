Finishing GROUPTHREAD.java class, including all methods. Still need to consult specification paper in order to confirm full functionality. Changed UserList.java in order to include data structure for groups

MainUserInterface.java added, and GroupClientSubInterface.java added. FileClientSubInterface will need created.

MainUserInterface is the main UI file. It connects to GroupClientSubInterface when the user selects to connect to the that
server.This allows for all the functionality you guys have been implementing to be functional.

Currently, it crashes while connecting to the group server. Theres a lot of code in there so I'll need to test it tomorrow after school and work.

I'm quite tired so I may have made a typo or a stupid error.

Can we add a check to return false if while creating a user, the user already exists?

Same with adding a new group?

Groups are saved improperly it seems. Everything is saving to UserList.bin Should there be a seperate file for groups?
